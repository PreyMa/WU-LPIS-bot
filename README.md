## ü§î How does it work
The script reads the source code of the LPIS page and allows you to select a course,
to register for. A timer is started when a course is selected. When the timer finishes
the page is reloaded and the script clicks the `anmelden` button as fast as possible.

There is no communication with other servers involved other than LPIS and none of
your Information leaves your browser. The whole system is to intended to emulate
a user with superhuman reflexes and mouse clicking speed, somewhat like a "fancy" autoclicker.

## ‚è≥ Correcting for bad latency
If you suffer from bad internet latency you can let the script send the request to
reload the page some time early. By default the script prefetches by 60ms. To adjust
this value for your personal internet connection open the advanced settings and
enter a new value in milliseconds.
